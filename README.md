# Digit Identification Project
This project used an algorithm called Perception and a Naive Bayesian algorithm in order to identify digits. Perceptron is an algorithm that applies a weighted number to the value of each feature in order to run predictions. These weights are changed depending on whether the algorithmâ€™s prediction was correct or not. The dot product of the vector of weights and features is taken in order to apply an overall prediction to an image. If the dot product is negative, then the algorithm predicted the image shown is not the same type of image as the label it is being compared to. And if the dot product is positive, then it predicted it is the same type of image as the compared label. During training if perceptron gets a negative dot product but the trained image actually is thesame type of image as its compared label, then the weights are too low and the values of the corresponding features are added to the weights. And if the dot product is positive, but images are not the same type, then those features are subtracted from the weights
